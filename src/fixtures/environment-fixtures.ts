/**
 * Playwright Fixtures for Environment Management
 *
 * This file defines custom Playwright fixtures that provide environment-specific
 * test data and configuration to test functions. Fixtures offer several advantages:
 *
 * 1. Automatic dependency injection into test functions
 * 2. Type-safe access to test data and configuration
 * 3. Isolation between tests
 * 4. Easy mocking and overriding for specific tests
 * 5. Consistent data access pattern across all tests
 *
 * Usage in tests:
 * ```typescript
 * test('login test', async ({ page, testData, envConfig }) => {
 *   await page.goto(testData.urls.loginUrl);
 *   // testData and envConfig are automatically injected
 * });
 * ```
